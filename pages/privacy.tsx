          E-mail: <Link href="mailto:contact@explainegy.com">contact@explainegy.com</Link>
        </p>
        <p>
          The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail
          addresses, etc.).
        </p>
        <h3>Storage duration</h3>
        <p>
          Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no
          longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally
          permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted once these reasons
          no longer apply.
        </p>
        <h3> General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website </h3>
        <p>
          If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) a DSGVO or Art. 9 (2) a DSGVO, if special categories of data are
          processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49
          (1) a DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your terminal device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), the data processing
          is additionally carried out on the basis of Section 25 (1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the performance of a contract or
          for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO. Furthermore, if your data is required for the
          fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our
          legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Information about the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs
          of this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries</h3>
        <p>
          Among other things, we use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these tools are active, your
          personal data may be transferred to these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU
          can be guaranteed in these countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to
          take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data
          located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
        <p>
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data
          processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>
        <h3> Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 DSGVO) </h3>
        <p>
          IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME
          FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN
          BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE
          PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER
          ARTICLE 21(1) DSGVO).
        </p>
        <p>
          IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR
          THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO
          LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (2) DSGVO).

        <h3>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual
          residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a
          common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>Information, deletion and correction</h3>
        <p>
          Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and
          the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of
          personal data, you can contact us at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of
          processing exists in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the
            restriction of the processing of your personal data.
          </li>
          <li> If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you may request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure. </li>
          <li>
            If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of
            your personal data instead of deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined
            whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise
          or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or
          a Member State.

        <h3>Google reCAPTCHA</h3>
        <p>
          We use &quot;Google reCAPTCHA&quot; (hereinafter &quot;reCAPTCHA&quot;) on this website. The provider is Google Ireland Limited (&quot;Google&quot;), Gordon House, Barrow
          Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to check whether the data input on this website (e.g. in a contact form) is made by a human or by an automated program. For this purpose,
          reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis begins automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the
          website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, time spent by the website visitor on the website or mouse movements made by the
          user). The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google.
        </p>
        <p> The reCAPTCHA analyses run completely in the background. Website visitors are not notified that an analysis is taking place. </p>
        <p>
          The storage and analysis of the data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its web offers from abusive
          automated spying and from SPAM. If a corresponding consent has been requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO and §
          25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user&apos;s terminal device (e.g. device fingerprinting) as
          defined by the TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.
        </p>
